## 💡 Handling Questions

### Q: "Why use 3D models?"
**A:** "To enhance engagement and make medical information more memorable. Studies show visual learning improves retention by 40%. Each treatment category has a themed model to create mental associations."

### Q: "How does the chat maintain context?"
**A:** "Every chat message includes a context object with patient demographics and the full analysis results. The backend formats this into the LLM prompt, ensuring personalized responses."

### Q: "What if the LLM fails?"
**A:** "Multiple safeguards: try-catch blocks, JSON validation, fallback error messages, and user-friendly error UI. The system never crashes - it degrades gracefully."

### Q: "Can this scale?"
**A:** "Absolutely. The modular architecture supports horizontal scaling. The API is stateless and can be load-balanced. For production, I'd add PostgreSQL, Redis caching, and cloud deployment."

### Q: "Why DeepSeek?"
**A:** "DeepSeek R1 offers strong medical reasoning at zero cost during development. For production, I'd evaluate GPT-4, Claude, or fine-tuned medical models based on accuracy benchmarks."
